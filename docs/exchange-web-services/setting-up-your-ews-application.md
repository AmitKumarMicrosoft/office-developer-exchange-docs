# Setting up your EWS application

Find information about the tasks you need to complete in order to create applications that use the EWS Managed API or EWS to communicate with Exchange. 
  
When you create a client application that calls web services on Exchange Online, Exchange Online as part of Office 365, or a version of Exchange starting with Exchange 2013, you'll need to set up your application to communicate with the Exchange server. The articles in this section provide code examples that show you how to use the Exchange Web Services (EWS) Managed API or EWS XML requests and responses to set up your application.
